# CLI

`cli` is the installed command-line adapter for Autonomous Workshop. It parses
commands, calls the public `workshop.workflow` host API, formats results, and
chooses exit codes. Lifecycle, native-session, gate, and effect behavior stays
in the component that owns it.

Run it from a source checkout with `PYTHONPATH=src python -m cli --help`, or use
the installed `workshop` command.

`workshop wish --effort spark|forge|quest "..."` freezes the selected route;
Spark is the default. Status and resume read that durable choice rather than
accepting a new effort value.
