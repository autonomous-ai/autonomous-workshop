part_fork_05.step.py: 0.29 cm3 solid, grid 0.133 mm (95x65x35), 16096 surface samples, thickness resolved to 0.067 mm

| check | status | detail |
|---|---|---|
| wall >= 0.80 mm (+/-0.07) | PASS | 0.0% of surface below (0 of 16096 samples) |
| thickness distribution | PASS | median 4.00 mm, p95 11.60 mm, max 12.00 mm |
| hollowable at 1.20 mm wall | WARN | 0.04 of 0.29 cm3 (15%) in 1 pocket(s) |
| filament that would save | PASS | 0.01 cm3, 0.0 g at 15% infill -- the slicer already leaves most of that space empty |


Measured on the entry's tessellated solid. The fix belongs in the
