# Knockseed

![Knockseed](make/verification/renders/iso.png)

A fingertip seed you flick so it spins on its rounded belly, then always knocks to rest on the same oval face.

| Frozen on this run | Value |
|---|---|
| Manager | Grok Build (`--manager grok`) |
| Effort | Spark (`--effort spark`) |
| Inventor | [Pico Press](../../inventors/pico-press/) |
| Factory | https://www.autonomous.ai/factory/product/knockseed |

## Workflow

Spark: `Wish -> Make -> Release`. Inventor selection is folded into Make.

| Stage | Attempts | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Wish | host | frozen |
| Match | 1 | accepted (Pico Press) |
| Invent | skipped | Spark pass-through |
| Make | 1 | accepted |
| Playtest | not run | Spark omission |
| Release | 1 | accepted |
| Publication | host | public |

Counts come from each stage's public `ATTEMPTS.json`. Skipped stages created no turn, artifact, or gate. Private host rejections and native session resumes are not public.

## How this toy was created

### 1. Wish — freeze the request

**Input:** the creator's request. **This toy's input:** A fingertip seed you flick so it spins on its rounded belly, then always knocks to rest on the same oval face.

**Output:** an immutable, hash-bound Wish plus its frozen effort route. The exact wording is withheld; this is the sanitized public summary in [the Wish binding](wish/wish.json).

### 2. Invent — choose an Inventor and define the concept

**Input:** the frozen Wish, eligible Inventor roster with each bound Taste/skill bundle, and the product blueprint. **Output:** **Pico Press** was selected and produced **Knockseed** — A fingertip-sized one-piece seed that spins on a rounded belly after a flick and always knocks to rest on the same ventral face. **Concept parts:** knockseed. The complete compact concept is in [make/invented.json](make/invented.json). Spark has no separate Invent Goal; selection and this compact concept were folded into Make.

### 3. Make — turn the concept into exact product bytes

**Input:** the accepted concept, selected Inventor identity/Taste, blueprint, and any bounded revision evidence. **Output:** A fingertip seed you flick so it spins on its rounded belly, then always knocks to rest on the same oval face. The sealed snapshot contains 1 STEP, 5 STL, 1 GLB and 2 product render PNGs, together with [CAD source](make/source/), [models](make/models/), and [deterministic verification](make/verification/). [The Made contract](make/made.json) binds those exact bytes.

### 4. Playtest — challenge the made product

**Input:** the sealed Made product, blueprint-required checks, and exact evidence. **Output:** not run on this effort route; Release preserves the explicit [omission record](release/PLAYTEST-NOT-RUN.json).

### 5. Release — make the customer package

**Input:** the sealed product and the passed Playtest evidence or truthful not-run record. **Output:** the hash-bound Release package, product facts, and printable [customer manual](release/MANUAL.pdf); see [the Release contract](release/release.json).

### 6. Publication — perform and verify the external effect

**Input:** the exact sealed Release package plus host-held Factory authorization; credentials never enter the native session. **Output:** [the public Factory product](https://www.autonomous.ai/factory/product/knockseed) and a sanitized, hash-verified [publication readback](publication/PUBLICATION.json).

## Run cost

| Measure | Value |
|---|---|
| Native Manager input tokens | unavailable (the Manager did not report input usage) |
| Native Manager cached input tokens | unavailable (the Manager did not report cache detail) |
| Native Manager uncached input tokens | unavailable (the Manager did not report cache detail) |
| Native Manager cache-write input tokens | unavailable (the Manager did not report cache detail) |
| Native Manager output tokens | unavailable (the Manager did not report output usage) |
| Native Manager reasoning output tokens | unavailable (the Manager did not report reasoning detail) |
| Wish to verified publication | 1h 5m 29s (2026-09-08T04:29:03Z to 2026-09-08T05:34:32.468193+00:00) |

Input and output tokens are best-effort separate counts reported by the native Manager; they are not added together. Cached plus uncached input equals the input covered by the economic breakdown, while cache writes and reasoning are reported as subsets rather than added again. No dollar cost is inferred. Elapsed time ends only after authenticated Factory public readback.

## Reproduce

From a checkout of this repository, verify the host and run the same Manager and effort route. This command uses the public product summary; a later run follows the same route but does not replay these exact CAD bytes.

```bash
uv run workshop doctor
uv run workshop wish --manager grok --effort spark 'A fingertip seed you flick so it spins on its rounded belly, then always knocks to rest on the same oval face.'
```

If a native turn stops before Release, continue the same Wish with `uv run workshop resume <wish-id>`.

- `MANIFEST.json` — hashes every workflow file except itself and this README.
- `SANITIZATION.json` — source/public hashes for host-local path prefixes replaced by stable placeholders.
- Playtest was not run; Release records that omission explicitly.
