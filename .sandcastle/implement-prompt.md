# TASK

Fix issue {{TASK_ID}}: {{ISSUE_TITLE}}

Pull in the issue using `gh issue view <ID>`. If it has a parent PRD, pull that in too.

Only work on the issue specified.

Work on branch {{BRANCH}}. Make commits and run tests.

# CONTEXT

Here are the last 10 commits:

<recent-commits>

!`git log -n 10 --format="%H%n%ad%n%B---" --date=short`

</recent-commits>

# EXPLORATION

Explore the repo and fill your context window with relevant information that will allow you to complete the task.

Pay extra attention to test files that touch the relevant parts of the code.

# EXECUTION

If applicable, use RGR to complete the task.

1. RED: write one test
2. GREEN: write the implementation to pass that test
3. REPEAT until done
4. REFACTOR the code

# FEEDBACK LOOPS

Before committing, run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run test` to ensure the tests pass.

# COMMIT

Make a git commit. Your commits are squashed into one commit titled after the
issue, and their messages become its body. The commit message must:

1. Start with `RALPH:` prefix
2. Include task completed + PRD reference
3. Key decisions made
4. Files changed
5. Blockers or notes for next iteration

Keep it concise.

# THE ISSUE

Do not close the issue - this will be done later.

When the issue is fully done, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.

If you cannot finish it (blocked, missing access, or out of scope), leave a
comment on the issue with what was done and what remains, commit any useful
partial work, then output <promise>INCOMPLETE</promise>. The issue stays open.

# FINAL RULES

ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK.
